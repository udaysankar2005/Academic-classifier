**Academic Abstract Classifier **

* An **Academic Abstract Classifier** is an NLP-based system used to automatically classify research paper abstracts into academic domains.

* It helps manage and organize the large volume of academic literature efficiently.

* The system takes a research abstract as input and predicts its subject area (e.g., AI, Healthcare, Finance, Education).

* Text preprocessing is performed to clean data using tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.

* Feature extraction methods like TF-IDF, word embeddings, or transformer embeddings are used.

* Machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression) or deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, BERT) are trained.

* The trained model learns patterns and keywords relevant to each academic field.

* New abstracts are classified automatically without manual intervention.

* It improves accuracy and speed in academic paper indexing and searching.

* Used in digital libraries, journal systems, research databases, and recommendation systems.

* Supports researchers in faster literature review and topic discovery.

* Reduces human effort and improves scalability in academic content management.
